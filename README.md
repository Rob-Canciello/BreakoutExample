# BreakoutExample

Welcome to my Breakout Clone!
Inside, you'll find one amazing, totally original, absolutely never seen before clone of Breakout!

Use A/D or the arrow keys to move your paddle left and right!
Bricks are worth more (but are harder to break) the further you go up.

The ball is /intentionally/swift. 
Gotta go fast!
If you can guess where the music is from, you and I are kindred spirits. 

Try to get the highscore!
